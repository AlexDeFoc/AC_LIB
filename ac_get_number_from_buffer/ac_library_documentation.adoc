= AC - get number from buffer - library documentation

== Library purpose
Get the value number from a buffer or string literal.

For example: char *string = "123" then the number gotten will be 123.

*Note*: the buffer has to contain number characters! For example: '0', '1'...

== Functions available
ac_size_t ac_get_number_from_buffer(

void *input_buffer,

ac_signed_size_t input_buffer_length,

void *output_number,

ac_signed_size_t output_number_type_size)

== Functions parameters explanation

1. ac_get_number_from_buffer:

* returns a unsigned error code
* parameters:
** takes in a buffer such as a string literal or array
** takes in a value/number length of of the buffer
** takes in a pointer to a variable into which to store the output number
** takes in the size of the type of the output number variable. Use *sizeof*.

== Syntax guide
- when a macro expands to two things, it's based on the system architecture,
either 32 or 64 bit

== Error codes
- 0 - function exited successfully
- 1 - _input buffer_ is null
- 2 - _input buffer length_ is smaller or equal to zero
- 3 - pointer to _output number_ is null
- 4 - _output number type size_ is smaller or equal to zero
- 5 - the _length of the input buffer_ provided is larger than the output number
type supports (which would've led to an overflow if the function didn't return)
- 6 - the character just read in the _input buffer_ is not a number (smaller than
'0' or larger than '9')

== Macro to take note of
- AC_ERROR_CODE_GET_NUMBER_FROM_BUFFER_NOT_A_NUMBER: expands to 6

== Explanations/reasons behind macros

=== Types for amount bytes

==== Macros:
- AC_TYPE_BYTES_1
- AC_TYPE_BYTES_2
- AC_TYPE_BYTES_4
- AC_TYPE_BYTES_8 (64 bit systems only)
- AC_TYPE_BYTES_MAX (expands to AC_TYPE_BYTES_4 or AC_TYPE_BYTES_8)

==== Reasons:
- Provide the ability to check how many bytes have been provided inside the
_output_number_type_size_ parameter
- Have a size for the max amount of bytes for the largest type supported by
the system, either 32 or 64 bits

=== Types for types lengths

==== Macros:
- AC_TYPE_BYTES_1_LENGTH
- AC_TYPE_BYTES_2_LENGTH
- AC_TYPE_BYTES_4_LENGTH
- AC_TYPE_BYTES_8_LENGTH (64 bit systems only)
- AC_TYPE_BYTES_MAX_LENGTH (expands to AC_TYPE_BYTES_4_LENGTH or
AC_TYPE_BYTES_8_LENGTH)

==== Reasons:
- Provide the ability to check if the _input_buffer_length_ is larger then the
max value supported by the _output_number_ type
- Have a length for the max value of the largest type supported by the system,
either 32 or 64 bits

=== Types for safety

==== Macros:
- ac_size_t (expands to int32_t or int64_t)
- ac_signed_size_t (expands to uint32_t or uint64_t)

==== Reasons:
- the type size_t is unsigned meaning if the user provides a negative value for
the parameteres _input_buffer_length_ or _output_number_type_size_ then it will
underflow and lead to undefined behaviour

=== Building
* the library uses CMake to build the library
* scripts available are for the platforms:
** windows (which is configured to use ninja as the build system)
