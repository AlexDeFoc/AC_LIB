3. The AC_LIB collection should not be used for producing any harm or malicious
code that may produce damages.

If you fail to comply with the AC_LIB collection license and use the
collectionâ€™s libraries for commercial or public purposes that provide financial
gain, popularity, or fame (excluding hobby or personal use that does not attract
significant public attention, or educational use for learning programming), your
right to use the collection will be terminated, and you must either cease using
it or bring your usage into compliance with the terms of the license within
