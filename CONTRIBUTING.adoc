== Prefix naming convention
In the AC_LIB collection it is required to prefix with characters _ac__ your:

* functions
* header files
* source files
* macros
* anything else that could potentially bring naming conflicts with external
code from the users of the libraries

== Coding style

1. **variables**:
   In the AC_LIB collection it is required to use camel_case naming.

2. **structs**:
   In the AC_LIB collection it is required to use Pascal case.

3. **macros**:
   In the AC_LIB collection it is required to use all uppercase letters.

4. **separating words**:
   In the AC_LIB collection it is very common to separate words in camel case.
   This applies to macros, variables, structs, and any other code elements,
   except for documentation where spaces are allowed.

5. **commenting**:
   Commenting your code is highly recommended. Your comments should be 80
   characters long on a single line, with more than 80 characters wrapping to
   the next line. The limit is 80 characters to provide better readability,
   including the 80th character but not the 81st.

== Modifying Existing Libraries
1. **Preserve author and contributor credits**:
   Ensure that the original authors and contributors are credited in the header
   files of the library.

2. **Add your credit**:
   Include your full name, username, or an anonymous pseudonym in the AC_LIB
   collection. If you choose an anonymous pseudonym, use the format
   _anonymous #_ (where # is replaced by the next available index, starting
   from 1).

3. **Provide meaningful improvements**:
   Contributions should provide significant value, such as bug fixes, code
   style improvements, performance enhancements, optimizations, or other
   improvements that elevate the quality of the library.

4. **Follow the pull request format**:
   When submitting a pull request, follow the format detailed in the
   _Pull Request Format_ section below.

5. **Document your changes**:
   If you add, remove, or modify any functionality, ensure that your changes are
   properly documented in the libraryâ€™s documentation file. Follow the
   guidelines outlined in the _Documentation Guide_ section below.

== Adding a New Library
1. **Library utility**:
   Your library should provide utility that improves and simplifies software
   development.

2. **Dynamic library**:
   Your library should be created to be dynamically linked. This helps with the
   ease of upgrading libraries and improves space efficiency.

3. **Edge case coverage**:
   Aim to cover as many edge cases and possible undefined behaviors as possible.
   Prioritize safety over performance by handling accidental misuse, such as
   panicking or returning error codes.

4. **Error handling**:
   Follow the AC_LIB collection's pattern for error handling. Return error codes
   in the case of unexpected behavior or edge-case hits, without printing text
   to avoid performance overhead.

5. **Documentation file**:
   Your library must contain a documentation file named
   _ac_library_documentation.adoc_. The AC_LIB collection exclusively uses
   AsciiDoc for documentation due to its ease of readability and wide
   compatibility across platforms. The documentation must follow the guidelines
   detailed in the _Documentation Guide_ section.

6. **Include test executables**:
   It is highly recommended to include test executables to demonstrate the
   potential usage of your libraries.

7. **Platform compatibility**:
   Ensure that your library supports both 32-bit and 64-bit systems, specifying
   in the documentation if compatibility is limited to one of these.

8. **Operating system agnosticism**:
   Aim for operating system compatibility, though this is not mandatory.
   Libraries should be easily adaptable for contributors working on different
   platforms.

9. **Folder structure**:
   Follow the folder structure outlined in the _Project Folder Structure_
   section below.

10. **CMake usage**:
    Use _CMake_ as the project toolchain generator. If you are familiar with
    other tools that do not complicate compatibility or usability, they may also
    be used.

11. **C Programming Language Version**:
    Your library should be compatible with the latest stable version of the
    C programming language (currently C17). C24 is excluded as it is not yet
    widely used.

12. **Script language**:
    The scripts inside your _scripts_ folder should be written in Bash, as users
    of the AC_LIB collection typically have access to Git Bash or other
    Bash environments.

13. **Coding language**:
    You must use English in all of your contributions, including pull requests,
    documentation, and coding.

== Pull Request Format
Your pull request should include the following:

1. **Appropriate label**:
   Include a label indicating the type of contribution, such as:
   - `bug-fix`
   - `upgrade`
   - `feature-proposal`
   - `library-proposal`

2. **Contribution explanation**:
   Provide a detailed explanation (in English, if possible) of how your
   contribution or library will benefit the AC_LIB collection.

3. **List of contributors and authors**:
   If you are submitting a new library, include a list of contributors and
   authors who have worked on the contribution.

== Documentation Guide
Your documentation file should include the following sections, which all
libraries must include:
Each section can be in any order and with different section titles.

1. **Library purpose**:
   In this section, write a short (if possible) explanation of what the library
   tries to achieve. If the library has multiple purposes, use a 
   bullet point list.

2. **Functions available**:
   In this section, write the functions, their parameters, and return types.
   Each parameter should be on its own line for better readability.

3. **Functions parameters explanation**:
   In this section, write a very short description for each parameter explained
   in the previous section. This is necessary because parameter names are often
   short, with little to no description.

4. **Syntax guide (if needed)**:
   In this section, explain shorthand abbreviations or any other expansions of
   text or further explanations of parts of the documentation file.

5. **Error codes**:
   In this section, list each return error code, including their respective
   description. These should be informative so users can refer to them in
   their code.

6. **Macros to take note of**:
   In this section, list macros that usually expand to error codes. This helps
   users to anticipate errors and cover them explicitly.

7. **Explanations/reasons behind macros**:
   In this section, explain the reasoning behind any macros used in the header
   files, especially those that help the code and library.

8. **Authors & Contributors (A-Z)**:
   In this section, list the authors and contributors who have worked on the
   library in alphabetical order.

9. **Documentation formatting**:
   Your documentation in the AsciiDoc files should follow the 80-character
   limit per line rule. After reaching the 80th character, place the next words
   on the next line for easier readability.

10. **Building**:
   Your documentation should include an explanation of how to build the library
   and what scripts are available to ease this process.

== Folder structure guide  
It is highly recommended to use the following file structure (almost mandatory).
If possible, adhere to it as it simplifies the overall project structure.
Each folder specific to a platform is optional, for example, if you are on
Windows, you won't need to create the `linux` or `darwin` folder.

1. **output**:
   * windows (folder)
     ** .lib (file)
     ** .dll (file)
     ** .exe (file)
     ** .h (file)
   * linux_arch (folder)
   * linux_debian (folder)
   * linux_..._any_other_distro (folder)
   * darwin (folder)
   ...

2. **scripts**:
   These should build the CMake file and copy the build library, executables,
   and header files into the output folder.
   - run_windows.sh (file)
   - run_linux_arch.sh (file)
   ...

3. **src**:
   * library
   * tests
     ** test_app_1.c

4. **CMakeLists.txt**

5. **.gitignore**:
   This should contain the `build` and `.cache` folders.

6. **ac_library_documentation.adoc**:
   This is the library documentation.
